Logistic Regression model was used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not using lab test results. 
PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset was used. 
Approach:
Data cleaning, outlier detection and variable selection. 
Detected and eliminated multicollinear variables by analyzing Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). 
Performed Logistic Regression to predict diabetes and analyzed the model using test data with evaluation parameters like Chi Square Good of Fit, ROC Curve and achieved model accuracy of 86%.
